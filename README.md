# Sketch_a_net-Matlab
This is written in matlab and show my understand of the paper " Sketch a net that beats human"      
How to use this net?      
1、download the TU_berlin sketch dataset    

2、change the path in the program（cnn_dicnn.m, cnn_image_setup_data.m,test_net_accuracy）     

3、run the cnn_dicnn.m      

4、finally run the test_net_accuracy to get how powerful of your net.    

Wish you good luck!
